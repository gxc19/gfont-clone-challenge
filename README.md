For this project, I worked with Jenny and Matt. Our task was to fork a version of Google Fonts which had the basic template, in which we had to add onto.


The features we had to implent were the following:

- Add more font styles
- Add a navigation bar which will only display the font names which have been entered
- Add a apply to all button
- Add a CSS information popup box when the user clicks in the plus button
